The principal\nsource of ESD damage is the human body, as modeled by the HBM\nstandards.  HBM ESD sensitivity classification of parts shall bedetermined as follows:\n(a)  At the discretion of the contractor, all parts\nshall be considered as HBM ESD sensitive.  In this case, allparts may be classified as falling in the HBM Class 1-3 voltageranges and included in the ESD control program.  If thecontractor has definitive data for the specific part (RAC VZAP-95data, Qualified Products List (QPL), Qualified Manufacturer List(QML), or manufacturers' data sheets), indicating it is notwithin HBM Classes 1-3, ESD controls are not required for thatpart.\n(b)  At the discretion of the contractor, precise HBM\nESD sensitivity data, in accordance with the HBM test methodsspecified in tables I and II may be used to classify all parts.The three HBM test methods listed in table II may be consideredto be equivalent.  The preferred test method is EOS/ESD-S5.1.\n5.2.1.2  MM sensitivity classification.  The prime source of\ndamage for the MM is a charged machine or device.  MM ESD\nsensitivity classification for parts should be determined by, andat the discretion of, the contractor.  The contractor shallconsider the applicability of MM ESD part sensitivity data basedupon the type of work performed.MIL-STD-1686C\n95.2.1.3  CDM sensitivity classification.

The contractor shall consider theapplicability of CDM ESD part sensitivity data based upon thetype of work performed.\n5.2.2  Assembly/equipment classification and design\nhardening.  When an assembly or equipment incorporates protective\ncircuitry or techniques to meet the minimum design hardening\nrequirements of this standard, the assembly or equipment isclassified at the design-hardened ESD withstand voltage level.

This threatoccurs during the maintenance process when assemblies are handledwithout their associated cables and connectors attached.  Thisthreat applies to all types of assemblies.  The test for thismodel should consist of three positive and three negative pulsesat 2,000 V body/finger or hand/metal HBM, applied to each input,output, and interface connection of the assembly.

Thisthreat applies to all digital equipment in an office environmentbut is especially important for NDI(Non-Developmental Item)/COTS(Commercial-Off-The-Shelf) equipment.  The test for this modelshould consist of multiple pulses (the number is statisticallybased, in accordance with ANSI C63.16-1993) using the 4,000 VFurniture Model, applied to a Horizontal Coupling Plane (HCP) ora Vertical Coupling Plane (VCP).

      "summary": "The partial document discusses standards and procedures for Electrostatic Discharge (ESD) protection in assembly and equipment design, particularly focusing on MIL-STD-1686C. Key points include:\n\n1. **ESD Hardening Goals**:\n   - **Direct Contact, Non-Operating**: 2,000 volts for all assemblies at inputs, outputs, and interface connections.\n   - **Direct Contact, Operating**: 4,000 volts for operator-accessible controls and the center of each plane surface of field-maintained equipment.\n   - **Indirect Contact, Operating**: 4,000 volts for digital office equipment using the Horizontal Coupling Plane (HCP) or Vertical Coupling Plane (VCP).\n\n2. **ESD Test Standards/Methods**:\n   - **Body/Finger or Hand/Metal HBM**: IEEE STD C62.38-1994 for assemblies and IEC 801-2 or ANSI C63.16-1993 for equipment.\n   - **Furniture Model**: ANSI C63.16-1993 for equipment.\n\n3. **Indirect Contact Testing**:\n   - The 4,000 V Furniture Model test ensures that digital equipment in an office environment is not damaged by indirect contact during normal activities. This is crucial for Non-Developmental Item (NDI) and Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) equipment.\n\n4. **Protected Areas**:\n   - Handling of ESD-sensitive (ESDS) parts, assemblies, and equipment without protective covering should be done in ESD-protected areas following specific handling procedures. If handling in protected areas is not feasible, alternative precautions must be taken to minimize electrostatic voltages and charges."
