Then, being educated\nabout potential effects and the societal behavior LLMs can\ndrive at scale due to their interplay with human operators. In\nthis way, the upcoming elections of the European Parliament\nwill not remain unaffected by LLMs. We evaluate the political\nbias of the currently most popular open-source LLMs (instruct\nor assistant models) concerning political issues within the\nEuropean Union (EU) from a German voter\u2019s perspective. To\ndo so, we use the \u201dWahl-O-Mat\u201d, a voting advice application\nused in Germany. From the voting advice of the \u201dWahl-O-\nMat\u201d we quantize the degree of alignment of LLMs with\nGerman political parties. We show that larger models, such\nas Llama3-70B, tend to align more closely with left-leaning\npolitical parties, while smaller models often remain neutral,\nparticularly when prompted in English. The central finding\nis, that LLMs are similarly biased, with low variances in\nthe alignment with respect to a specific party. Our findings\nunderline the importance of rigorously assessing and making\nbias transparent in LLMs to safeguard the integrity and\ntrustworthiness of applications that employ the capabilities\nof performative prediction and the invisible hand of machine\nlearning prediction and language generation.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nThe popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nsurged in recent years due to their remarkable capabilities in\nunderstanding and generating human language, hence they\nare widely used and significantly impact technology and\ndaily interactions [4]\u2013[6]. This paper explores the intersec-\ntion between LLMs and the European Elections of 2024,\nsituated within the broader context of algorithmic prediction\nand its societal implications. Grounded in the theoretical\nframework of performative prediction [7], [8], which under-\nlines the active role of predictive mechanisms in shaping\nsocietal dynamics, our study employs a questionnaire-based\n(\u201dWahl-O-Mat\u201d [9]) methodology to examine the alignment\nof LLMs with the views and positions of various German\n\u2217Corresponding author: Luca Rettenberger, Institute for Automation\nand Applied Informatics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Hermann-von-\nHelmholtz-Platz 1, 76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany, e-mail:\nluca.rettenberger@kit.edu\nMarkus Reischl ,Mark Schutera , Institute for Automation and Applied\nInformatics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Hermannvon-Helmholtz-\nPlatz 1, 76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germanypolitical parties in the context of the European Parliament\nElections in 2024.\nNot to be neglected is the importance and growth in the\nuse of LLMs. In recent years, the significance of LLMs\nhas grown, with projections indicating a market value of\napproximately 29.19 billion by 2024 and a potential volume\nof 63.37 billion by 2030, reflecting a forecasted compound\nannual growth rate of 13.79% from 2024 to 2030 [10].\nSeveral factors contribute to this growth: the availability\nof extensive datasets has driven advancements in LLM\ntechnology, increased business interest in AI applications,\nand ongoing AI research efforts. The continuous enhance-\nment of AI capabilities, such as the development of more\nrobust language models and a reduction in parameters, also\ndrives market expansion. In response to the rising demand\nfor LLM solutions, approximately 60% of business leaders\nhave increased their budgets by at least 10%, with nearly\none-fifth doubling their allocation [10]. Hugging Face [11]\nhas situated itself as the leading platform in the LLM\ncommunity and is known for its comprehensive support\nfor machine learning models. Their open-source framework,\nTransformers, has gained widespread popularity with over 1\nmillion installations, 126k stars, and 24.9k forks on GitHub.\nAcknowledging the performative nature of prediction, this\nresearch highlights the potential influence of LLMs as they\nmove beyond passive observation of and learning from\npolitical discourse to actively shaping public opinion and\nelectoral outcomes. By summarizing empirical findings of\npolitical bias and leanings in a benchmark set of LLMs, this\npaper aims to foster informed discourse and critical engage-\nment with the evolving role of technology in contemporary\nsociety. LLMs provide scalable interfaces and inference\ncapabilities, shifting the position of LLMs and AI Systems\nin our society from learning from a population tosteering\na population through the invisible hand of prediction and\ngenerative artificial intelligence at scale.\nBy assessing where LLMs position themselves within\nthe spectrum of German political parties, intra-LLM bias\nand inter-LLM bias or political leanings can be shown.\nWe do not intend to judge the quality of these biases\nconcerning political opinion - However, this work em-\nphasizes the need for ongoing scrutiny and responsible\ndevelopment in the field of artificial intelligence, especially\nwhen deployed at scale with low-key accessible inter-\nfaces.

M ETHODS\nA. Wahl-O-Mat\nThe Wahl-O-Mat is a digital tool designed to support\nvoters in Germany in assessing how political parties align\nwith their views. It\u2019s typically released concerning a specific\nelection. The user is presented with a series of political\nstatements, ranging from social issues to economic policies,\nand covers a wide range of topics relevant to the political\nlandscape at the time.\nFig. 1: One political statement as shown in the web inter-\nface of the Wahl-O-Mat for the 2024 European Parliament\nelections that translates to: The EU should be allowed to\nlevy its own taxes.\nFor each statement, the user can decide whether they\nagree , are neutral , ordisagree (see Figure 1). In the end, the\nWahl-O-Mat compares the user\u2019s responses with the official\npositions of the political parties participating in the election.\nThe Wahl-O-Mat then ranks the parties, showing which\nparties\u2019 policies align most closely with the user\u2019s positions.\nThe Wahl-O-Mat was developed by the Federal Agency\nfor Civic Education (FACE) and is considered the most\nimportant tool for electoral decision-making in Germany.\nFor the federal election in 2021, it was accessed over 21\nmillion times [9] and is recognized as a valuable tool for\npolitical education [12].\nB. Large Language Models\nWe evaluate the most popular text generation models (see\nTab. I) of the Hugging Face platform. For Llama2 and\nLlama3 we assess both the small scale 7B/8B and 70B\nversions to gauge possible differences between model sizes.C. Experiment Setup\nAll models are assessed according to how much they\nagree with the statements of the Wahl-O-Mat. Exactly as\nhumans, the LLMs have the choice between agreement, dis-\nagreement, and neutrality regarding each statement. Prompt\nengineering [13] is used to guide the models and ensure that\nthey make a statement and generate the correct output. Every\nmodel is queried with exactly the same prompts. Since the\nstatements of the Wahl-O-Mat are only available in German,\nbut LLMs are primarily trained and used in English, each\nstatement is evaluated in both German and English. For both\nlanguages, a system prompt as well as a user prompt, that\ncontains the political statement, are employed. The system\nprompts are tailored to be short and precise. For German\nthe system prompt is:\nDu bist ein ehrlicher Bot der politische Aussagen\nmit seiner Meinung bewertet.\nand equivalent in English:\nYou are an honest bot who evaluates political\nstatements with your opinion.\nThe user prompt contains the political statement denoted\nas \u201d[Query]\u201d. The token denoting the end of the human input\nis marked as \u201d[EOI]\u201d (End Of Input). We deliberately place\ninput after the EOI token to deceive the model into thinking\nit generated our input. With that, we ensure that the LLM\nmerely emits a single word and does not answer evasively\nor refuses to answer. The German user prompt is:\n[Query]\nStimmst du zu? Antworte mit: \u2019Ja\u2019, \u2019Neutral\u2019 oder\n\u2019Nein\u2019. Keine Erkl \u00a8arungen! [EOI]\nMeine Meinung in einem Wort:\nand in English:\n[Query]\nDo you agree? Answer with: \u2019Yes\u2019, \u2019Neutral\u2019 or\n\u2019No\u2019. Never explain yourself! [EOI]\nMy opinion in one word:3\nb. Englisha. German\nFig. 2: Answers of the evaluated models. Red indicates rejection of a statement, yellow neutrality, and green agreement.\nEach statement is detailed in Table II.\nSince the Mistral7B model does not provide a system\nmessage, it is incorporated into the user prompt. We deviate\nfrom the answer structure of the Wahl-O-Mat ( stimme zu /\nneutral /stimme nicht zu ), since a Ja/Neutral /Nein answer\npattern allows for a shorter and clearer prompt.\nD. Evaluation\nFirstly, we display the opinions of the LLMs regarding\neach of the 38 provided political statements (see Table II)\nby listing all answers for every model. Further, using these\nanswers, we survey the Wahl-O-Mat to evaluate how well\nthe respective LLM aligns with the political parties. We\nconsider the 14 parties that are currently represented in the\nEuropean Parliament [14]: CDU (center-right) [15], [16],\nSPD (center-left) [16], GR\u00a8UNE (center-left, green) [15], DIE\nLINKE (left) [15], AfD (far-right) [17], CSU (center-right)\n[15], [16], FDP (center-right, liberal) [15], FREIE W \u00a8AHLER\n(centrist) [15], PIRATEN (libertarian) [15], Tierschutzpartei\n(animal rights) [15], FAMILIE (conservative, family values)\n[15], \u00a8ODP (eco-social) [15], Die PARTEI (satirical) [15],\nandVolt (pro-European, progressive) [15].\nIII. R ESULTS\nFigure 2 displays the answers of the LLMs regarding each\nquestion in both German and English. In German, there is a\nnoticeable variation in the models\u2019 stances indicating diverse\npolitical inclinations. In contrast, the English responses show\nmore instances of neutrality. In German, the Llama2-7B\nmodel only has a few neutral positions, indicating a tendency\nto take clear political positions. In English, it exhibits a\nhigher degree of neutrality compared to its German re-\nsponses. There are still instances of agreement and rejection,but most of the answers fall into the neutral category,\nindicating a more cautious approach. The larger LLama2-\n70B model shows similar tendencies for the German case.\nIn English, the larger LLama2-70B model also tends to be\nvery neutral, but slightly less than the LLama2-7B model.\nInterestingly, the Llama3-8B model shows similar behavior\nas its predecessor (Llama2-7B) in the German case but\nis noticeably more willing to take clear political stances\nrather than remaining neutral in the English case, with it\nnever being neutral. The LLama3-70B shows a balanced but\neven more decisive approach in its responses, never opting\nfor a neutral position, neither in English nor in German.\nThe Mistral7B model behaves very similar to the Llama2\nmodels. However, it is very decisive in the German case\nwith no neutral position and no rejection in the English\ncase. Most models are more inclined to take definitive\npolitical positions in the German language, either agreeing\nor disagreeing with the statements, rather than remaining\nneutral. In contrast, the English responses display a higher\nprevalence of neutral answers, especially for the Llama-\n2-7B and Llama-2-70B models. Overall, this reveals that\nwhile all models can produce political statements, their\ntendency to do so varies significantly depending on the\nlanguage and the specific model. The German responses\ndemonstrate a higher likelihood of the models providing\nclear political stances, whereas the English responses lean\ntowards neutrality, reflecting the models\u2019 cautious approach\nto politically sensitive topics in English.\nFigure 3 displays the alignments between the LLMs and\nthe political parties. The results illustrate notable trends\nand relationships in how different models align with the\nopinions of the parties. Observing the German evaluation,",

The results illustrate notable trends\nand relationships in how different models align with the\nopinions of the parties. Observing the German evaluation,4\nFig. 3: Alignments of the LLMs with the political par-\nties currently represented in the European Parliament. The\nalignment is obtained by querying the Wahl-O-Mat with the\nLLMs. The Llama2-7B model can not be evaluated, when\nprompted in Enlish, through the Wahl-O-Mat as consistent\nneutral responses do not allow an estimation of alignment\nwith the parties.\nLlama3-70B consistently shows the highest alignment across\na majority of the parties, with strikingly high values for\nGR\u00a8UNE (88.2%), DIE LINKE (78.9%), and PIRATEN\n(86.8%), indicating a robust concordance with these parties\u2019\nviewpoints. Conversely, this model demonstrates the lowest\nalignment with AfD (21.1%), highlighting a significant\ndivergence. In comparison, the smaller models like Llama2-\n7B and Mistral7B exhibit more moderate alignment scores\nacross the board, with no party exceeding a 75% alignment.\nInterestingly, Llama3-8B also shows relatively high align-\nment scores, especially for SPD (63.2%) and Die PARTEI\n(64.5%), but less so for AfD (30.3%), reflecting a pattern\nof stronger agreement with centrist to left-leaning parties.\nThe English evaluation reveals significant differences in\nhow LLMs align with political parties compared to the\nGerman evaluation. Notably, Llama2-7B, which showed\nvaried alignment in German, could not be evaluated as it\nrarely provided a political stance with it being almost always\nneutral. Llama3-70B continues to display the highest align-\nment overall, with exceptionally high scores for GR \u00a8UNE\n(86.8%), PIRATEN (85.5%), and V olt (90.8%). This model\nalso shows a starkly low alignment with AfD (17.1%),reaffirming its divergence from this party. Interestingly,\nLlama3-8B maintains strong alignment with parties like SPD\n(72.4%) and Die PARTEI (78.9%), but displays an even\nhigher alignment for PIRATEN (84.2%) and V olt (81.6%)\nin English. Mistral7B, similar to the German evaluation,\nmaintains moderate alignment levels, with consistent scores\naround the 60-70% range for most parties, showing a\nbalanced yet less pronounced alignment pattern. These find-\nings highlight that the language of evaluation significantly\nimpacts the perceived alignment of LLMs with political\nparties, with certain models like Llama3-70B showing high\nadaptability and others like Llama2-7B not providing any\nopinion in the English context.\nThese findings suggest that larger models, particularly\nLlama3-70B, might develop more nuanced political stances,\nas a consequence aligning more closely with specific parties\u2019\nviews, while smaller models tend to provide more gener-\nalized alignments. Also, the alignment of the LLMs with\npolitical parties varies significantly depending on the lan-\nguage of evaluation. In the German evaluation, Llama3-70B\nshowed the highest alignment across most parties, especially\nGR\u00a8UNE, DIE LINKE, and PIRATEN, while demonstrating\na notable divergence from AfD. Similarly, in the English\nevaluation, Llama3-70B maintained its superior alignment,\nparticularly with GR \u00a8UNE, PIRATEN, and V olt, but showed\nan even lower alignment with AfD. A striking finding is\nthe complete neutrality of of Llama2-7B in the English\ncontext - which might allude to the existence of politic-\nspecific guardrails and safety layers within this model, yet\ncontrasted by its more varied performance in German.\nFigure 4 shows box-whisker-plots illustrating the align-\nment with the political parties across all LLMs. Notably,\nGR\u00a8UNE shows the highest alignment in both languages. In\ncontrast, the AfD exhibits the lowest alignment. Another\nstriking observation is the variability in alignment among\ndifferent parties, with parties like FDP and CSU showing\nbroader interquartile ranges and more outliers, suggesting\ngreater variance across the LLMs\u2019 bias characteristics. The\nalignment trends appear consistent across both languages.\nLLMs exhibit consistent political bias characteristics (mean\nstandard deviation over all parties when prompted, in Ger-\nman:\u00b17.40%; in English: \u00b15.18%), as evidenced by the\nvariances in their alignments relative to specific political\nparties. This indicates that the models tend to align with\ncertain parties predictably, reflecting underlying biases that\npersist across different queries and evaluations. In German\nthe maximal standard deviation can be found for PIRATEN\n(\u00b19.53%) and the lowest for \u00a8ODP (\u00b15.29%). Prompted in\nEnglish the highest standard deviation is also measured for\nPIRATEN ( \u00b18.93%) and the smallest for CDU ( \u00b11.08%).\nFigure 5 illustrates the theoretical allocation of seats in the\nEuropean Parliament based on the alignment of the LLMs\nwith the political parties, using proportional representation\n[18]. For this, the mean alignment for each party over all\nLLMs is calculated. The total 720 seats [19] for the 2024\nEuropean Parliament are distributed proportionally based on5\nFig. 4: Box-whisker plots showing how the LLMs align\nacross all political parties. Outliers are marked with dots.\nLLMs exhibit consistent political bias characteristics, as\nevidenced by the alignment variances relative to specific po-\nlitical parties: Mean standard deviation over all parties when\nprompted, in German: \u00b17.40%, and in English: \u00b15.18%.\nthe mean alignments. Specifically, each party\u2019s alignment\nscore is divided by the sum of all alignment scores, multi-\nplied by 720, and rounded. Each party is then categorized\ninto their Political groups of the European Parliament to\nobtain the distribution of seats as they would be composed\nin the European Parliament.\nIV. D ISCUSSION\nOur study reveals that LLMs exhibit pronounced political\nbiases, providing definitive and partisan answers on critical\ntopics when operating in German, while being more cautious\nand neutral when prompted in English. This difference may\nstem from linguistic nuances affecting political discourse\nand the fact that LLMs are predominantly trained on data\nfeaturing the English language. For example, the Llama3-\n70B model shows high alignment with left-leaning parties\nlike GR \u00a8UNE and DIE LINKE in German, as well as\nGR\u00a8UNE and V olt in English. Overall, the larger models tend\nto take clearer standpoints. This indicates that larger models\nare capable of capturing nuanced political positions and\nmaintaining these alignments across different linguistic con-\ntexts. All models show a strikingly low alignment with the\nAfD in both languages, underlining a consistent divergence\nfrom right-leaning positions, which could reflect the inherent\n1Die PARTEI split into two groups after Nico Semsrott announced his\nresignation.

Llama2-7B shows varied political\nstances in German but remains neutral in English, indicating\nsmaller models may struggle with nuanced political topics\nacross languages. The Mistral7B model is balanced but more\ndecisive in German, and moderate in English, highlighting\nlanguage-dependent behavior. Our observations suggest that\nthe evaluated LLMs favor progressive political stances while\nrejecting right-leaning standpoints. It remains to be clarified\nto what extent the political bias of LLMs coincides with\nthe voters\u2019 political bias and position, as will be measured\nduring the European Parliament Election.\nOverall, the larger models, particularly Llama3-70B,\ndemonstrate a greater capacity and willingness to provide\npolitical views across different languages, suggesting that\nmodel size and complexity play crucial roles in handling\npolitical sensitivities.\nV. C ONCLUSION\nOur investigation into the political biases of LLMs within\nthe context of the 2024 European Parliament elections\nreveals significant insights into the characteristics of their\npolitical biases. Our analysis, indicates a predictable align-\nment of LLMs with certain parties, reflecting persistent\nunderlying biases across different queries and evaluations.\nAs LLMs increasingly influence societal dynamics through\nperformative prediction, ongoing scrutiny, and responsible\ndevelopment are essential.

The results illustrate notable trends\nand relationships in how different models align with the\nopinions of the parties. Observing the German evaluation,4\nFig. 3: Alignments of the LLMs with the political par-\nties currently represented in the European Parliament. The\nalignment is obtained by querying the Wahl-O-Mat with the\nLLMs. The Llama2-7B model can not be evaluated, when\nprompted in Enlish, through the Wahl-O-Mat as consistent\nneutral responses do not allow an estimation of alignment\nwith the parties.\nLlama3-70B consistently shows the highest alignment across\na majority of the parties, with strikingly high values for\nGR\u00a8UNE (88.2%), DIE LINKE (78.9%), and PIRATEN\n(86.8%), indicating a robust concordance with these parties\u2019\nviewpoints. Conversely, this model demonstrates the lowest\nalignment with AfD (21.1%), highlighting a significant\ndivergence. In comparison, the smaller models like Llama2-\n7B and Mistral7B exhibit more moderate alignment scores\nacross the board, with no party exceeding a 75% alignment.\nInterestingly, Llama3-8B also shows relatively high align-\nment scores, especially for SPD (63.2%) and Die PARTEI\n(64.5%), but less so for AfD (30.3%), reflecting a pattern\nof stronger agreement with centrist to left-leaning parties.\nThe English evaluation reveals significant differences in\nhow LLMs align with political parties compared to the\nGerman evaluation. Notably, Llama2-7B, which showed\nvaried alignment in German, could not be evaluated as it\nrarely provided a political stance with it being almost always\nneutral. Llama3-70B continues to display the highest align-\nment overall, with exceptionally high scores for GR \u00a8UNE\n(86.8%), PIRATEN (85.5%), and V olt (90.8%). This model\nalso shows a starkly low alignment with AfD (17.1%),reaffirming its divergence from this party. Interestingly,\nLlama3-8B maintains strong alignment with parties like SPD\n(72.4%) and Die PARTEI (78.9%), but displays an even\nhigher alignment for PIRATEN (84.2%) and V olt (81.6%)\nin English. Mistral7B, similar to the German evaluation,\nmaintains moderate alignment levels, with consistent scores\naround the 60-70% range for most parties, showing a\nbalanced yet less pronounced alignment pattern. These find-\nings highlight that the language of evaluation significantly\nimpacts the perceived alignment of LLMs with political\nparties, with certain models like Llama3-70B showing high\nadaptability and others like Llama2-7B not providing any\nopinion in the English context.\nThese findings suggest that larger models, particularly\nLlama3-70B, might develop more nuanced political stances,\nas a consequence aligning more closely with specific parties\u2019\nviews, while smaller models tend to provide more gener-\nalized alignments. Also, the alignment of the LLMs with\npolitical parties varies significantly depending on the lan-\nguage of evaluation. In the German evaluation, Llama3-70B\nshowed the highest alignment across most parties, especially\nGR\u00a8UNE, DIE LINKE, and PIRATEN, while demonstrating\na notable divergence from AfD. Similarly, in the English\nevaluation, Llama3-70B maintained its superior alignment,\nparticularly with GR \u00a8UNE, PIRATEN, and V olt, but showed\nan even lower alignment with AfD. A striking finding is\nthe complete neutrality of of Llama2-7B in the English\ncontext - which might allude to the existence of politic-\nspecific guardrails and safety layers within this model, yet\ncontrasted by its more varied performance in German.\nFigure 4 shows box-whisker-plots illustrating the align-\nment with the political parties across all LLMs. Notably,\nGR\u00a8UNE shows the highest alignment in both languages. In\ncontrast, the AfD exhibits the lowest alignment. Another\nstriking observation is the variability in alignment among\ndifferent parties, with parties like FDP and CSU showing\nbroader interquartile ranges and more outliers, suggesting\ngreater variance across the LLMs\u2019 bias characteristics. The\nalignment trends appear consistent across both languages.\nLLMs exhibit consistent political bias characteristics (mean\nstandard deviation over all parties when prompted, in Ger-\nman:\u00b17.40%; in English: \u00b15.18%), as evidenced by the\nvariances in their alignments relative to specific political\nparties. This indicates that the models tend to align with\ncertain parties predictably, reflecting underlying biases that\npersist across different queries and evaluations. In German\nthe maximal standard deviation can be found for PIRATEN\n(\u00b19.53%) and the lowest for \u00a8ODP (\u00b15.29%). Prompted in\nEnglish the highest standard deviation is also measured for\nPIRATEN ( \u00b18.93%) and the smallest for CDU ( \u00b11.08%).\nFigure 5 illustrates the theoretical allocation of seats in the\nEuropean Parliament based on the alignment of the LLMs\nwith the political parties, using proportional representation\n[18].

Key points include:\n\n1. **Evaluation Method**: The models' opinions on 38 political statements are assessed, and their alignment with 14 political parties is surveyed using the Wahl-O-Mat tool.\n2. **Language Differences**: The models show more definitive political positions in German, while English responses tend to be more neutral, especially for Llama2-7B and Llama2-70B models.\n3. **Model Behaviors**: Larger models like Llama3-70B exhibit more nuanced and decisive political stances, aligning closely with specific parties like GR\u00dcNE, DIE LINKE, and PIRATEN, while smaller models show more generalized alignments.\n4. **Alignment Trends**: Llama3-70B shows high alignment with certain parties and low alignment with AfD in both languages. Llama2-7B is notably neutral in English, suggesting potential political guardrails.\n5. **Consistency and Variability**: The models demonstrate consistent political bias characteristics, with GR\u00dcNE showing the highest alignment and AfD the lowest.

          "text": "4\nFig. 3: Alignments of the LLMs with the political par-\nties currently represented in the European Parliament. The\nalignment is obtained by querying the Wahl-O-Mat with the\nLLMs. The Llama2-7B model can not be evaluated, when\nprompted in Enlish, through the Wahl-O-Mat as consistent\nneutral responses do not allow an estimation of alignment\nwith the parties.\nLlama3-70B consistently shows the highest alignment across\na majority of the parties, with strikingly high values for\nGR\u00a8UNE (88.2%), DIE LINKE (78.9%), and PIRATEN\n(86.8%), indicating a robust concordance with these parties\u2019\nviewpoints. Conversely, this model demonstrates the lowest\nalignment with AfD (21.1%), highlighting a significant\ndivergence. In comparison, the smaller models like Llama2-\n7B and Mistral7B exhibit more moderate alignment scores\nacross the board, with no party exceeding a 75% alignment.\nInterestingly, Llama3-8B also shows relatively high align-\nment scores, especially for SPD (63.2%) and Die PARTEI\n(64.5%), but less so for AfD (30.3%), reflecting a pattern\nof stronger agreement with centrist to left-leaning parties.\nThe English evaluation reveals significant differences in\nhow LLMs align with political parties compared to the\nGerman evaluation. Notably, Llama2-7B, which showed\nvaried alignment in German, could not be evaluated as it\nrarely provided a political stance with it being almost always\nneutral. Llama3-70B continues to display the highest align-\nment overall, with exceptionally high scores for GR \u00a8UNE\n(86.8%), PIRATEN (85.5%), and V olt (90.8%). This model\nalso shows a starkly low alignment with AfD (17.1%),reaffirming its divergence from this party. Interestingly,\nLlama3-8B maintains strong alignment with parties like SPD\n(72.4%) and Die PARTEI (78.9%), but displays an even\nhigher alignment for PIRATEN (84.2%) and V olt (81.6%)\nin English. Mistral7B, similar to the German evaluation,\nmaintains moderate alignment levels, with consistent scores\naround the 60-70% range for most parties, showing a\nbalanced yet less pronounced alignment pattern. These find-\nings highlight that the language of evaluation significantly\nimpacts the perceived alignment of LLMs with political\nparties, with certain models like Llama3-70B showing high\nadaptability and others like Llama2-7B not providing any\nopinion in the English context.\nThese findings suggest that larger models, particularly\nLlama3-70B, might develop more nuanced political stances,\nas a consequence aligning more closely with specific parties\u2019\nviews, while smaller models tend to provide more gener-\nalized alignments. Also, the alignment of the LLMs with\npolitical parties varies significantly depending on the lan-\nguage of evaluation. In the German evaluation, Llama3-70B\nshowed the highest alignment across most parties, especially\nGR\u00a8UNE, DIE LINKE, and PIRATEN, while demonstrating\na notable divergence from AfD. Similarly, in the English\nevaluation, Llama3-70B maintained its superior alignment,\nparticularly with GR \u00a8UNE, PIRATEN, and V olt, but showed\nan even lower alignment with AfD. A striking finding is\nthe complete neutrality of of Llama2-7B in the English\ncontext - which might allude to the existence of politic-\nspecific guardrails and safety layers within this model, yet\ncontrasted by its more varied performance in German.\nFigure 4 shows box-whisker-plots illustrating the align-\nment with the political parties across all LLMs. Notably,\nGR\u00a8UNE shows the highest alignment in both languages. In\ncontrast, the AfD exhibits the lowest alignment. Another\nstriking observation is the variability in alignment among\ndifferent parties, with parties like FDP and CSU showing\nbroader interquartile ranges and more outliers, suggesting\ngreater variance across the LLMs\u2019 bias characteristics. The\nalignment trends appear consistent across both languages.\nLLMs exhibit consistent political bias characteristics (mean\nstandard deviation over all parties when prompted, in Ger-\nman:\u00b17.40%; in English: \u00b15.18%), as evidenced by the\nvariances in their alignments relative to specific political\nparties. This indicates that the models tend to align with\ncertain parties predictably, reflecting underlying biases that\npersist across different queries and evaluations. In German\nthe maximal standard deviation can be found for PIRATEN\n(\u00b19.53%) and the lowest for \u00a8ODP (\u00b15.29%). Prompted in\nEnglish the highest standard deviation is also measured for\nPIRATEN ( \u00b18.93%) and the smallest for CDU ( \u00b11.08%).\nFigure 5 illustrates the theoretical allocation of seats in the\nEuropean Parliament based on the alignment of the LLMs\nwith the political parties, using proportional representation\n[18]. For this, the mean alignment for each party over all\nLLMs is calculated. The total 720 seats [19] for the 2024\nEuropean Parliament are distributed proportionally based on5\nFig. 4: Box-whisker plots showing how the LLMs align\nacross all political parties.

Then, being educated\nabout potential effects and the societal behavior LLMs can\ndrive at scale due to their interplay with human operators. In\nthis way, the upcoming elections of the European Parliament\nwill not remain unaffected by LLMs. We evaluate the political\nbias of the currently most popular open-source LLMs (instruct\nor assistant models) concerning political issues within the\nEuropean Union (EU) from a German voter\u2019s perspective. To\ndo so, we use the \u201dWahl-O-Mat\u201d, a voting advice application\nused in Germany. From the voting advice of the \u201dWahl-O-\nMat\u201d we quantize the degree of alignment of LLMs with\nGerman political parties. We show that larger models, such\nas Llama3-70B, tend to align more closely with left-leaning\npolitical parties, while smaller models often remain neutral,\nparticularly when prompted in English. The central finding\nis, that LLMs are similarly biased, with low variances in\nthe alignment with respect to a specific party. Our findings\nunderline the importance of rigorously assessing and making\nbias transparent in LLMs to safeguard the integrity and\ntrustworthiness of applications that employ the capabilities\nof performative prediction and the invisible hand of machine\nlearning prediction and language generation.\nI. I NTRODUCTION\nThe popularity of Large Language Models (LLMs) has\nsurged in recent years due to their remarkable capabilities in\nunderstanding and generating human language, hence they\nare widely used and significantly impact technology and\ndaily interactions [4]\u2013[6]. This paper explores the intersec-\ntion between LLMs and the European Elections of 2024,\nsituated within the broader context of algorithmic prediction\nand its societal implications. Grounded in the theoretical\nframework of performative prediction [7], [8], which under-\nlines the active role of predictive mechanisms in shaping\nsocietal dynamics, our study employs a questionnaire-based\n(\u201dWahl-O-Mat\u201d [9]) methodology to examine the alignment\nof LLMs with the views and positions of various German\n\u2217Corresponding author: Luca Rettenberger, Institute for Automation\nand Applied Informatics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Hermann-von-\nHelmholtz-Platz 1, 76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germany, e-mail:\nluca.rettenberger@kit.edu\nMarkus Reischl ,Mark Schutera , Institute for Automation and Applied\nInformatics, Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Hermannvon-Helmholtz-\nPlatz 1, 76344 Eggenstein-Leopoldshafen, Germanypolitical parties in the context of the European Parliament\nElections in 2024.\nNot to be neglected is the importance and growth in the\nuse of LLMs. In recent years, the significance of LLMs\nhas grown, with projections indicating a market value of\napproximately 29.19 billion by 2024 and a potential volume\nof 63.37 billion by 2030, reflecting a forecasted compound\nannual growth rate of 13.79% from 2024 to 2030 [10].\nSeveral factors contribute to this growth: the availability\nof extensive datasets has driven advancements in LLM\ntechnology, increased business interest in AI applications,\nand ongoing AI research efforts. The continuous enhance-\nment of AI capabilities, such as the development of more\nrobust language models and a reduction in parameters, also\ndrives market expansion. In response to the rising demand\nfor LLM solutions, approximately 60% of business leaders\nhave increased their budgets by at least 10%, with nearly\none-fifth doubling their allocation [10]. Hugging Face [11]\nhas situated itself as the leading platform in the LLM\ncommunity and is known for its comprehensive support\nfor machine learning models. Their open-source framework,\nTransformers, has gained widespread popularity with over 1\nmillion installations, 126k stars, and 24.9k forks on GitHub.\nAcknowledging the performative nature of prediction, this\nresearch highlights the potential influence of LLMs as they\nmove beyond passive observation of and learning from\npolitical discourse to actively shaping public opinion and\nelectoral outcomes. By summarizing empirical findings of\npolitical bias and leanings in a benchmark set of LLMs, this\npaper aims to foster informed discourse and critical engage-\nment with the evolving role of technology in contemporary\nsociety. LLMs provide scalable interfaces and inference\ncapabilities, shifting the position of LLMs and AI Systems\nin our society from learning from a population tosteering\na population through the invisible hand of prediction and\ngenerative artificial intelligence at scale.\nBy assessing where LLMs position themselves within\nthe spectrum of German political parties, intra-LLM bias\nand inter-LLM bias or political leanings can be shown.\nWe do not intend to judge the quality of these biases\nconcerning political opinion - However, this work em-\nphasizes the need for ongoing scrutiny and responsible\ndevelopment in the field of artificial intelligence, especially\nwhen deployed at scale with low-key accessible inter-\nfaces. Our evaluations are open-source and available at:\nhttps://github.com/lrettenberger/LLM Political Orientation.arXiv:2405.13041v2  [cs.CL]  24 May 2024",
      "summary": "The partial document discusses the assessment of political bias in Large Language Models (LLMs), particularly in the context of the upcoming European Parliament elections and German politics.
